Somewhat experimental setup for tracking canonical versions of Learn notebooks in version control.

`partials/python/` contains 'templates' for all the notebooks in the Python track (with `tut_1.ipynb` being the first tutorial notebook, `ex_1.ipynb` being the corresponding exercise notebook, etc.). This is where notebook editing should happen.

These notebooks contain some 'macros' in the source of some cells, such as `#$END_OF_EXERCISE$` or `#$EXERCISE_URL(4)$`. These get replaced (see `lesson_preprocessor.py`) when rendering the final notebook. To render some notebooks (writing them to the `rendered/` subdirectory), use `render.sh`. e.g.

    render.sh partials/python/*.ipynb

When you're ready to sync changes to the site, run `prepare_push.py`, passing the name of the track to prepare (e.g. `prepare_push.py python`). This will create a directory structure in a subdirectory `pushables` which is amenable to the Kernels API.

To push a particular notebook, do something like...

    cd pushables/python/ex_4
    kaggle k push -p .

(NB: Should be possible to do in just one step like...

    kaggle k push -p pushables/python/ex_4
    
But API currently has some issues when run on a directory other than pwd.)

The ipynbs in the `pushables` subdir set up by `prepare_push.py` are symlinks to the corresponding files in `rendered/` so you generally shouldn't have to run `prepare_push.py` again unless you add another notebook, or change a notebook's metadata in a way that would affect `kernel-metadata.json` (i.e. changing the title or slug).

Note: currently keeping `rendered/` notebooks under version control. At first this seemed like a bad idea, because in some sense they're "build products", and redundant wrt the template notebooks. However, I think it's really useful to be able to see the diff of a rendered notebook from the previous rendered version before pushing, as an assurance/sanity check.
