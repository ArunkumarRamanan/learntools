Issues
------
- Globals binding statefulness (see comment in `globals_binder.py`)

Feature requests / Nice-to-haves
-----
- add some tests to learntools.core
- rework `bind_exercises`. Add overarching "Exercise" objects for containing Problems. See comments in `utils.py`.
- Helpers for exploiting a canonically correct implementation of a function for `FunctionProblem`s.
- add "abstract attribute" enforcement (see comment at top of problem.py)
- more factory syntax conveniences for problem creation
- convenient syntax for per-variable custom checking?
- Some kernel support for automagically running standard setup code in learn notebooks
- Some convenience for initializing an exercise module with standard boilerplate (imports at top, `bind_exercises` stuff at the bottom)
- Make ProblemViews (and Problems?) aware of their canonical `bind_exercises` name for more helpful messages. (See Hint "coda" for example)
- revive/complete scripts for autogenerating (/autotesting) exercise notebook skeleton 
- some helper for checking variable types in Problem.check() implementations
- some helper for testing notebooks to exec a problem's CodeSolution source and verify that checking passes?
